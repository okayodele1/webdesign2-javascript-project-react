The essence of this NGO website lies in its ability to effectively communicate the mission, values, and objectives of the non-governmental organization to its audience. The website serves as a digital platform for the NGO to engage with supporters, donors, volunteers, and beneficiaries. It provides information about the NGO's projects, achievements, and needs, facilitating transparency and accountability.

Key elements of an NGO website include:

1.	About Us: A section that details the NGO's history, mission, vision, and team to provide visitors with a clear understanding of the organization's purpose and goals.

2.	Programs and Projects: Information about ongoing and completed initiatives that demonstrate the NGO's work and impact on the community or cause it serves.

3.	How to Help: Clear instructions on how visitors can support the NGO, whether through donations, volunteering, or participating in events and campaigns.

4.	News and Updates: A blog or news section to keep stakeholders informed about the latest developments, success stories, and challenges the NGO faces.

5.	Contact Information: Easy-to-find contact details and a form for inquiries, fostering communication and collaboration with the public.

6.	Donation: A secure and straightforward way for visitors to make financial contributions to support the NGO's work.

7.	Multimedia: Photos, videos, and other multimedia elements that showcase the NGO's activities and the people it helps, creating an emotional connection with the audience.

8.	Testimonials and Impact Stories: Personal accounts and narratives that highlight the effectiveness and importance of the NGO's work.

9.	Social Media Integration: Links to social media profiles to extend engagement and reach a wider audience.

User-Friendly Design
The website is user-friendly, accessible, and mobile-responsive to ensure that all visitors, regardless of device or ability, can access the information and engage with the NGO's cause.

Coding Languages Choice: I used JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

Challenges: 
•	Selecting the right colour and arrangement posed initial challenges. I overcame this by researching options and seeking advice from colleagues.
•	Identifying design inconsistencies on different devices through testing will be a continuous process. I will resolve issues by refining the design and conducting subsequent tests.
•	Balancing continuous improvements with day-to-day responsibilities will require strategic planning. I will prioritize tasks based on impact and urgency to manage this effectively.
•	Achieving routing with JavaScript alone was a bit difficult, so I opted for an express module in node JS.
•	I use one single index page to route every other pages.
•	The routing wont giver users the opportunity to know which directory my files reside and It also makes the website load faster
•	Making the pages component based so that the codes can be reuseable.
•	I used the form validation that won’t allow user to submit empty form
In summary, I approached the technical challenges of building the NGO website by making informed decisions, seeking assistance when needed, and staying proactive in addressing issues. Continuous learning, adaptability, and a commitment to the NGO's mission was the key factors in overcoming technical challenges and ensuring the website's success.

Challenges in Deployment:
I encounter difficulties trying to deploy on netlify but after several attempts  and trying out vercel, it eventually deployed on vercel
